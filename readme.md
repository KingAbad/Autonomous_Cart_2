# Project - Autonomous cart

Autonomous cart was one of the 3 main projects of the subject **Project Reasearch** given by several professors of the university-college **PXL**. The main goal of Autonomous cart was to turn a ordinary golf cart into a fully self-driving campus taxi that takes it passengers to their desired locations. The three main technologies that were needed to make this project a succes were: IOT, AI and Automation technology. As of our task to be the brain of this project it was our main responsibility to the IOT side of this project. And that is also what this repository is about.

**Poject requirements**
* Jumper wires
* RFID-RC522
* RFID tags
* IIC LCD-Display
* Buzzer module
* RGB led
* Breadboard
* Arduino IDE

**Step by step guide**
* Open the Arduino IDE 
* Plug in your Arduino Nano (used by me) in your laptop.
* Start building your circuit (open my schematic)
* Copy and paste the my .ino code in your IDE.
* Look if you have the right board selected
* Also select the right serial COM port ypur Arduino is connected to
* Upload the code into your Arduino and it should work

**Note**
You have to change the UID of mine tag to the UID of your tag.
To know this UID open one of the simple RFID-RC522 reading examples in the Arduino IDE.
